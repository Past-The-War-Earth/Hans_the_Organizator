# Hans the Organization

Hans the Organization was the first implemented PTWE App. Humorously named it was intended to be a family organizer (that was was "going to be [Huge](https://github.com/Data-Independence-Network/trunk-core/blob/main/docs/History_Drivers_and_Overview.md)!" - I didn't "sell out" on the imagined monetary potential,  the necessity of a technology for the App and the associated "cool off" came later, and decided to share my overenthusiastic idea with as many friends as possible trying to get them involved. No thoughts of it's even more important NLNM purpose could have been present.). Now it has found it's "home" and in the also very important [NLNM simulations](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/NLNM-combat-simulation/issues/1).

The original idea in it is "gravity balls" - color and size coded (Eithnhower Matrix based) circles that gravitationally fall together, with biggest tasks coming in first in the middle.  This is a great intuitive AR heads up display for NLNM commanders that can re-assemble every time there is a change in task composition, importance or urgency.
